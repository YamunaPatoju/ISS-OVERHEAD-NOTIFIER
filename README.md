# ISS-OVERHEAD-NOTIFIER

ISS OVER HEAD NOTIFIER


This Python script sends you an email when the International Space Station (ISS) is passing over your location at night.

The script checks the current position of the ISS.
It also checks if it's night time at your location.
If both conditions are true, it sends you an email to let you know the ISS is above you.

FEATURES:
-ISS Position Check: Determines if the ISS is overhead within a +/- 5 degree radius of your specified location.
-Night Time Check: Uses sunrise and sunset times to check if it's currently night at your location.
-Email Notification: Sends an email to your Gmail address when both conditions are true (ISS overhead and night time).
-Environment Variables: Sensitive data like email credentials are stored in environment variables for security.

CONTRIBUTING: Pull requests are welcome! Feel free to open an issue if you want to suggest changes.
